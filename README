kernel play
===========

*messing around with some loadable kernel modules (LKM)*

Just trying to learn more about the internals of the linux kernel.  I expect lots of crash -n- burn, so 
I will be using this project to help re-provision my systems when they die. 

REQUIREMENTS:
requires kernel headers installed (and reboot after) to build
	
	(FEDORA)
	sudo dnf install kernel-devel
	sudo reboot -h now
