kernel play
===========

*messing around with some loadable kernel modules (LKM)*

Just trying to learn more about the internals of the linux kernel.  I expect lots of crash -n- burn, so 
I will be using this project to help re-provision my systems when they die. 

Requirements
-------------
requires kernel headers installed (and reboot after) to build
	
	(FEDORA)
	sudo dnf install kernel-devel
	sudo reboot -h now


Project Layout
--------------
hello_world/    - char device that can be loaded and unloaded (nothing more)
lkm_device/	- char device that supports open/close/read/write operations
lkm_ioctl/	- char device that supports ioctl operations (also reorganized the file structure)


Usage
-----
every makefile provides the commands all/clean/test
